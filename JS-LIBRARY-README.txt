Library: Fabric.js  
https://github.com/fabricjs/fabric.js 
http://fabricjs.com/ 

Description: 
Fabric.js is a javascript library that facilitates interacting with HTML5 canvases in javascript. Additionally, Fabric incorporates a functional layer to the canvas API, which facilitates interactivity for objects in a canvas element, and supports parsing to and from the SVG image format. These API's simplify the steps needed to be taken, in order to manipulate and draw visual objects within your browser. 
Fabric was created by Juriy Zaytsev in 2008, to facilitate his personal needs for his startup project (printio.ru); over time, Zaytsev signed on various developers, of which currently consists of two developers in addition to Zaytsev (Stefan Kienzle and Andrea Bogazzi.) The members of the current Fabric team are all independent developers, who work on fabric.js on their own spare time.   

File Size:
284Kb is the current file size for the all-inclusive minified version of fabric.js. Versions can be reduced/tailored to needed modules only, by utilizing http://fabricjs.com/build/  (the version that contains all required files for my basic demo, for instance, only is 138Kb). 

Dependencies: 
Fabric.js runs without any additional library needs, and as stated above, can be reduced in size depending on which modules are used.  

Functionality/Reusability: 
Fabric.js provides a vast range of functionality when regarding HTML5 canvas manipulation. For my own use, there was no feature that was needed or otherwise wanted( that I was able to come up with, regarding canvases that Fabric did not provide). My main desire with for improvement towards fabric.js, would be for them to provide better/clearer documentation with more fleshed out examples. As it stands, their current documentation can be a little rough to parse, if you do not know what you’re looking for. Fabric's documentation largely assumes its users have an in depth knowledge, of which fledgling programmers like myself, ordinarily do not immediately start with.  

Robust:  
Supported browsers: 
•	Firefox 2+
•	Safari 3+
•	Opera 9.64+
•	Chrome (all versions)
•	IE10, IE11, Edge 

Performance: 
Fabric.js opts for performance as a critical tenant of its library’s implementation; operating well on both mobile and desktop clients. In addition, Fabric  provides a list of benchmarks and tests here: http://fabricjs.com/test/ 
Maturity: Fabric.js has been in development since 2008 –  version 2.0 dropped in February of this year, and is currently on version 2.3; and as such is a fairly mature platform, at least in terms of age. 

Supportive Community: 
Fabric.js is used by several websites that incorporate interactive drawing features, online arcade games, meme generators, and photo editors - the most notable among these would perhaps be: shutterstock.com, Ludus.one, digitalsignage.com, maglr.com, roll20.net, TUI image editor, and formerly of scrollkit.com (which was of course bought, dismantled and incorperated by WordPress).  Fabric.js has gained a modest amount of growth over the years, with a fairly active developer community. When searching around for resources, there were many entries on stackoverflow/jsfiddle/etc for Fabric ( including a decently maintained wiki - https://github.com/fabricjs/fabric.js/wiki  , active issue tracking - https://github.com/fabricjs/fabric.js/issues , and pull requests - 
https://github.com/fabricjs/fabric.js/pulls ). 

Ongoing development: 
Fabric.js is actively maintained and developed by its core team of 3; the fabric team has produced updates as recently as May 21st, 2018. Fabric is largely sustained out of personal interest, part of which resulted in the utilization of fabric.js, in the founders other website, a t-shirt customization site.
   
Documentation: 
Fabric.js's documentation provides material for all included items; however, in terms of examples and explanations: fabric can bear a learning curve in its assummption that one has a strong knowledge of HTML canvases/JS. This may often result in an experience that may not be beginner inclined. With some effort and digging, one can navigate their way around, but this of course requires a fair amount of persistence, and patience. The quantity of Fabric's documentation is acceptable, albeit scattered - in addition to a quality in terms of formality, leaves something to be desired (especially when looking for an organized introduction).

Developer Support Tools: 
Fabric enjoys great developer support with options such as the ability to customize your js package and many options for extending their functionality.

Library: Paper.js
http://paperjs.org/
http://github.com/paperjs/paper.js

File Size: 232Kb with the full library, 201Kb with the core

Dependencies: Paper.js runs without any additional library needs and can be reduced to a core function set to further reduced size.

Functionality: Paper.js provides advanced canvas rendering functionality by providing much more than a simple wrapper around the canvas object. It allows the user to create advanced vector graphics scenes, as well as providing image and input handling utilities. 

Robust: Paper.js requires browsers that support Canvas object and EcmaScript 5; Older browsers, like IE8, may not work with Paper.js

Performance: Advanced scenes might not render well on older mobile devices; Paper.js is intended for more advanced graphic displays.

Maturity: Development began in 2011 and has been continuously developed since.

Supportive Community: Paper.js has a high-profile showcase http://paperjs.org/showcase/ - with users such as the New York Times, Google Creative Labs, Foursquare and many others, the community is very active around Paper.js. 

Ongoing development: Paper.js sees active development, with typically at least 2 major releases per year.

Documentation: http://paperjs.org/reference/ 
provides extensive documentation, and while it can be a little difficult to navigate, it provides in depth references for all provided software. http://paperjs.org/examples/ provides a series of in-depth examples, as well as an editor that lets you see the code as well as modify and run your changes right on the site.
